### git hub notes
In order to avoid errors, it is important to commit changes after changing the code then push them.
If you want to get updates you can pull them by submitting a pull request
Use fetch if you want to see the changes before pulling

#### HTML
This is the place you start. The first page must be called the index page, as this is what they look for to be your starting page. You can create different pages of HTML for different pages of your website that link to eachother. 

#### CSS
CSS can be used for styling when it gets to be too complicated in the HTML tags. However there are lots of frameworks that allow you to use them directly in HTML, like Bootstrap. Bootstrap is the most common one to use, hence the similar styling across all websites. 

#### Midterm review
The <link> HTML element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
A period ( . ) indicates a class, and a hash ( # ) indicates an ID.
Padding represents the amount of inner space an element has, while the margin is whitespace available surrounding an element. 
An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, with some semantic differences and deliberate limitations in usage:
Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments, or super, and should not be used as methods.
Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. Calling them with new throws a TypeError. They also don't have access to the new.target keyword.
Arrow functions cannot use yield within their body and cannot be created as generator functions.
The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or HTML documents. It is important to realize that these interfaces are an abstraction - much like "abstract base classes" in C++, they are a means of specifying a way to access and manipulate an application's internal representation of a document. In particular, interfaces do not imply a particular concrete implementation. Each DOM application is free to maintain documents in any convenient representation, as long as the interfaces shown in this specification are supported. Some DOM implementations will be existing programs that use the DOM interfaces to access software written long before the DOM specification existed. Therefore, the DOM is designed to avoid implementation dependencies; in particular,

Attributes defined in the IDL do not imply concrete objects which must have specific data members - in the language bindings, they are translated to a pair of get()/set() functions, not to a data member. (Read-only functions have only a get() function in the language bindings).
DOM applications may provide additional interfaces and objects not found in this specification and still be considered DOM compliant.
Because we specify interfaces and not the actual objects that are to be created, the DOM can not know what constructors to call for an implementation. In general, DOM users call the createXXX() methods on the Document class to create document structures, and DOM implementations create their own internal representations of these structures in their implementations of the createXXX() functions.

port 80 is used for HTTP traffic
port 443 is used for HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) traffic
By default, port 22 is open on all IBM StoredIQ hosts. The port is used for Secure Shell (SSH) communication and allows remote administration access to the VM
