#### HTML
This is the place you start. The first page must be called the index page, as this is what they look for to be your starting page. You can create different pages of HTML for different pages of your website that link to eachother. 

#### CSS
CSS can be used for styling when it gets to be too complicated in the HTML tags. However there are lots of frameworks that allow you to use them directly in HTML, like Bootstrap. Bootstrap is the most common one to use, hence the similar styling across all websites.
